# Workshop 04: Cardano Ticker

With all the basic building blocks in place, lets start with some (more) real world use cases: In this workshop you will learn how to fetch Cardano token prices from the realfi.info API and display them neatly on your Microcontroller. We will also briefly introduce you to the Taptools.io API and include a quick way to fetch NFT prices from JPG.store.
