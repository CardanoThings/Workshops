# CardanoThings Workshops - Code Examples

This repository contains all the Arduino code examples from the CardanoThings workshops. These examples are organized by workshop and can be used directly in the Arduino IDE.

## 📚 Workshop Documentation

For complete tutorials, step-by-step instructions, and detailed explanations, visit the workshops on [cardanothings.io](https://cardanothings.io):

- **[Workshop 01: The Basics](https://cardanothings.io/workshops/01-basics)** - Set up your Cardano wallet, Arduino IDE, and make your first API call
- **[Workshop 02: Read and Output](https://cardanothings.io/workshops/02-read-and-output)** - Read data from the blockchain and output it to displays and hardware
- **[Workshop 03: Input and Write](https://cardanothings.io/workshops/03-input-and-write)** - Read sensor data and put it on-chain using APIs
- **[Workshop 04: Cardano Ticker](https://cardanothings.io/workshops/04-cardano-ticker)** - Build a ticker to display token prices and NFT floors
- **[Workshop 05: QR-Code Payments](https://cardanothings.io/workshops/05-qr-code-payments)** - Build a payment system with QR codes on your microcontroller

Each example folder contains:
- `*.ino` - Arduino sketch file (ready to open in Arduino IDE)
- `README.md` - Documentation and usage instructions

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Arduino IDE** - Download from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. **Install ESP32/ESP8266 Board Support** - Follow the setup guide in [Workshop 01](https://cardanothings.io/workshops/01-basics/arduino-setup)
3. **Open an Example** - Navigate to any workshop folder, open the example folder, and double-click the `.ino` file
4. **Follow the Workshop** - Visit the corresponding workshop page on [cardanothings.io](https://cardanothings.io) for detailed instructions

## 📖 Using the Examples

Each example is designed to work with the Arduino IDE. Simply:

1. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE
2. Install any required libraries (instructions in each example's README)
3. Update WiFi credentials and other configuration as needed
4. Upload to your microcontroller
